# Background

From the [Genomic Data Commons (GDC) website](https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/about-gdc):

> The National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) Genomic Data Commons (GDC)
> is a data sharing platform that promotes precision medicine in
> oncology. It is not just a database or a tool; it is an expandable
> knowledge network supporting the import and standardization of
> genomic and clinical data from cancer research programs.
>
> The GDC contains NCI-generated data from some of the largest and
> most comprehensive cancer genomic datasets, including The Cancer
> Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Therapeutically Applicable Research to
> Generate Effective Therapies (TARGET). For the first time, these
> datasets have been harmonized using a common set of bioinformatics
> pipelines, so that the data can be directly compared.
>
> As a growing knowledge system for cancer, the GDC also enables
> researchers to submit data, and harmonizes these data for import
> into the GDC. As more researchers add clinical and genomic data to
> the GDC, it will become an even more powerful tool for making
> discoveries about the molecular basis of cancer that may lead to
> better care for patients.

## Data Model

The data model for the GDC is complex, but it worth a quick overview
of the types of data and the data model look like.

# Accessing Data

There are several available endpoints:

- Projects
- Files
- Cases
- Annotations
- _mappings

The following sections address each in turn.

## Projects

```{r project10}
a = projects()
datatable(a)
```

## Files

```{r files10}
fields <- c("data_type", "updated_datetime", "created_datetime",
    "file_name", "md5sum", "data_format", "acl", "access", "state",
    "data_category", "file_size", "submitter_id", "type")
a = files(fields=fields)
datatable(do.call(rbind, a))
```

## Cases

```{r cases10}
a = cases()
a             # 10 cases by default
lengths(a)    # cases have different elements
a[1]          # summary
head(a[[1]])  # values
```

## Annotations

```{r annotations10}
a = annotations()
datatable(do.call(rbind, a))
```

## Mapping

```{r mapping10}
a = mapping('projects')
a               # available information
a["defaults"]   # default fields
a[["defaults"]] # default fields as character()
a["fields"]     # all fields
```

# SessionInfo

```{r sessionInfo}
sessionInfo()
```
